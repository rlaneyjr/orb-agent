# Contributing to orb-agent

orb-agent hosts the discovery backends (device, network, snmp, gnmi), the snmp
telemetry backend, and the worker alongside the agent in a single repository. To
keep versioning and release notes coherent across all of these, the release
pipeline keys off **PR titles** — so titles must follow the convention below.

## How releases work

- PRs are **squash-merged into `develop`**; the PR title becomes the single
  commit message. `develop` is later promoted to `release`.
- **A versioned agent release fires only on agent-scoped changes** (under
  `agent/` or `cmd/`) or via a manual `workflow_dispatch`. A backend-only change
  does **not** cut a new agent version — backends release on their own cadence,
  and a small backend release should not force an agent version bump.
- When an agent release does fire, it **aggregates everything**: the release
  notes include every commit since the last `vX.Y.Z` tag — agent changes and any
  interim backend changes — grouped by type and scope.
- **Per-backend releases** cut their own version from commits scoped to that
  backend (filtered by `orb-discovery/<backend>/**` or
  `orb-telemetry/<backend>/**`, whichever holds it), tagged
  `<backend>/v<version>` (e.g. `snmp-discovery/v1.2.3`). First-party worker
  packages under `orb-discovery/workers/<name>/` release the same way (e.g.
  `arista-cv/v1.2.3`). The `semantic-release-monorepo` plugin renders the GitHub
  Release *title* with a dash (`snmp-discovery-v1.2.3`); this is cosmetic — the
  git tag and ref keep the slash form. `worker` and `device-discovery` publish
  to PyPI; first-party packages under `orb-discovery/workers/` are baked into
  the agent image from source (use `INSTALL_WORKERS_PATH` only for custom /
  third-party packages or to override a baked package locally).
- Pushing to `develop` rebuilds and publishes the `orb-agent:develop` image.
  This fires on changes under `agent/`, `cmd/`, `orb-discovery/` or
  `orb-telemetry/`, so a change to a backend the image bundles still refreshes
  it continuously.
- The **Validate PR title** check runs on every PR targeting `develop`. Once it
  is marked a required status check in branch protection, it blocks merge when
  the title doesn't match the convention; until then it reports status without
  blocking.

## PR title convention (enforced)

Use a Conventional Commits title with **one scope** from the allowlist:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

The automated check requires an allowlisted scope and rejects unknown scopes or
a subject that starts with an uppercase letter.

### Allowed types

`feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `revert`

### Allowed scopes

Agent:

- `agent` — the orb-agent itself. `feat`/`fix`/`perf` here cuts an agent release.

Releasable backends (each cuts its own release and contributes to the
aggregated agent release):

- `device-discovery`
- `gnmi-discovery`
- `gnmi-telemetry`
- `network-discovery`
- `snmp-discovery`
- `snmp-telemetry`
- `worker`
- `a10-control`
- `arista-cv`
- `cisco-intersight`
- `nutanix-pc`
- `paloalto-panorama`
- `vmware-vcenter`

Other scopes:

- `deps` / `deps-dev` — dependency bumps (e.g. from Dependabot). `chore(deps)`
  cuts a **patch**; `chore(deps-dev)` does not release.
- `ci` — CI / workflow changes (no release)
- `docs` — documentation (no release)
- `repo` — repo-wide / cross-cutting changes (no release)

### Type → release mapping

| Type / commit | Release |
|---------------|---------|
| breaking (`!` suffix or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) | major |
| `feat` | minor |
| `fix` | patch |
| `perf` | patch |
| `chore(deps)` | patch |
| everything else (`docs`, `ci`, `test`, `refactor`, `build`, other `chore`) | none |

> **Agent version vs. non-agent scopes.** The mapping above is the per-component
> rule. For the **agent** release specifically, both the backend scopes
> (`device-discovery`, `network-discovery`, `snmp-discovery`, `gnmi-discovery`,
> `gnmi-telemetry`, `snmp-telemetry`, `worker`, `a10-control`, `arista-cv`,
> `cisco-intersight`, `nutanix-pc`, `paloalto-panorama`, `vmware-vcenter`) and
> the no-release scopes (`repo`, `ci`, `docs`,
> `deps-dev`) are set to `release: false`, so even a releasing *type* on those
> scopes (e.g. `feat(repo)`, `fix(ci)`) does **not** bump the agent version.
> Backend commits still appear in the aggregated agent release notes. The one
> exception is a backend **breaking change** (`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer), which
> `semantic-release` always treats as major; such a change bumps the agent to a
> major as well.

### Keep PRs scoped

Prefer one component per PR so the scope is unambiguous. Cross-cutting work
should use the `repo` scope or be split into per-component PRs.

## Examples

- `feat(agent): add fleet-mode backend restart backoff`
- `fix(agent): respect context cancellation in policy apply`
- `docs(device-discovery): lead with supported driver and vendor counts`
- `chore(deps): bump go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk`
- `ci(repo): bump GitHub Actions to Node 24-compatible releases`
